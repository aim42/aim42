[[View-Based-Understanding]]
==== [pattern]#View Based Understanding# 

===== Intent
Understand the inner workings and internal (code) structure of of the systems. Document (and communicate) this via
architectural views, especially the building-block view.

===== Description

* Apply <<arc42>> views
* Apply <<Static-Code-Analysis>>
* Interview technical stakeholders
* Start either from the 
   ** business context, mainly the external business interfaces
   ** technical context, the involved hardware and network structure
   ** known technology areas, i.e. products, programming languages or frameworks used

===== Applicability
Use view-based-understanding when:

* System has a medium to large codebase
* Structural understanding of the code is limited: only few stakeholders can explain
and reason about the code structure
* Documentation of the code structure is not existing, outdated or wrong
* Long-term maintenance and evolution of the system is required 


===== Consequences

* Explicit overview of the system context with the external interfaces.
* Overview of the larger units of source-code (subsystems, high-level components) and their relationships.

===== Also Known As

* building block view (formerly known as logical view)
* high-level overview
