===== Intent


===== Description

The Database Last approach, also called the
Reverse Migration Method, is based on a similar
concept to the Database First approach and is also
suitable only for fully decomposable legacy systems.
Legacy applications are gradually migrated to the target
platform while the legacy database remains on the
original platform. The legacy database migration is the
final step of the migration process.  As with the
Database First approach, a gateway is used to allow for
the interoperability of both information systems. In this
case a Reverse Gateway enables target applications to
access the legacy data management environment. It is
employed to convert calls from the newly created
applications and redirect them to the legacy database
service, as shown in Fig. 1.

If the legacy database service is to be migrated to a
relational database management service, then the target
applications will be developed completely with SQL
calls to the data service.  It is these calls that are
captured by the Reverse Gateway and converted to the
equivalent legacy calls.  The Database Last approach
has a lot in common with the client/server paradigm.
The legacy database takes on the role of a database
server with the  target applications operating as clients.
There are commercial products available which
effectively act as reverse gateways.

The Database Last approach is not without its
problems however. Performance issues can be raised
with regard to the gateway.  The Reverse Gateway will
be responsible for mapping the target database schema
to the legacy database.  This mapping can be complex
and slow which will affect the new applications. Also
many of the complex features found in relational
databases (integrity, consistency constraints, triggers
etc.), may not be found in the archaic legacy database,
and hence cannot be exploited by the new application.

This approach is probably more commercially
acceptable than the Database First approach as legacy
applications can continue to operate normally while
being redeveloped. 

However, the migration of the
legacy data will still require that the legacy system be
inaccessible for a significant amount of time.  When
dealing with mission critical information systems, this
may be unacceptable
