=== Goals

Make the issues, problems and risks found during the <<Analyze, analysis>>
comparable by estimating or measuring their *value*
(that's why we call this activity *evaluate*):

. estimate _value_ of problems, issues, risks and their remedies
. prioritize issues, their remedies and improvement measures

Usually, evaluation implies _estimation_, only in few cases can you measure
or observe the evaluation subject and produce _hard facts_.

.Evaluation Domain Concepts
|===
| Domain concept | Explanation | Example
| Estimation | an _approximation_ of any subject
  (here: issues, problems or remedies), which is needed because
	facts or real observations are not available or possible.
|
| Subject    |  | a recurring problem in the <<System>> or
associated processes
| Parameter  | an important element or foundation of the
estimation.
a|
	* number of developers on the system
    * Lines-of-Code (LOC)

| Assumption | a fixed setting for any parameter.
  See <<Explicit-Assumption>>
|

| Observation | measure, count, calculate gather real data
for parameters  | if every developer is
concerned by the problem, we count their number.

| Interval   | see <<Estimate-In-Interval>> | between 15% and 25%

// the detailed description of the evaluation-patterns
[[Estimate-Feature-Value]]
==== [pattern]#Estimate Feature Value#

===== Intent
Estimate the (monetary) value of a given feature, so you can compare features of the system with each other.

===== Description
* Involve business or management stakeholders, as they often have a clear notion of business value.
* If you cannot determine real numbers available, use <<Explicit-Assumption, explicit assumptions>>
* Instead of numbers, you might use categories or orders-of-magnitude (like small, medium, large). You should prefer numbers, though!



[[Estimate-In-Interval]]
==== [pattern]#Estimate in Interval#
===== Intent
Estimation is a guess, not a *measurement*.
Estimates are uncertain, otherwise, they would be observations (or measurements!).

===== Description
Therefore, estimate in intervals, giving a lower and upper bound to your estimate. The difference between the two shows your confidence in the estimate. If this difference is relatively small, it shows high confidence.

CAUTION: Be aware of the anchoring effect http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring

Good estimates ensure that the estimated value will be contained in the interval with a very high probability.

Estimates often rely on assumptions - which should be <<Explicit-Assumption>>.



[[Estimate-Issue-Cost]]
==== [pattern]#Estimate Issue Cost#

===== Intent
Find out how much a given issue costs in units of money or effort in a period or for every occurrence.

===== Description
_Finding out_ the cost of an issue usually requires estimation or guessing, so there are
uncertainty and probability involved.

For example, if a server needs to be rebooted once every 24hrs and an operator needs 30 minutes to perform this reboot (and corresponding activities), then you can approximate the cost of this problem for, let's say, a month:

5 workdays × 4 weeks × 30 min = 10hrs of operator's effort.

If you multiply with (an approximated or averaged) wage, you get _problem cost_.

* If possible, try to _measure_ or observe instead of guessing or estimating.
* If you cannot determine real numbers, and you need to guess, estimate or approximate, use <<Explicit-Assumption>>.
