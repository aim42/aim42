== Asciidoc Help

To facilitate contributions we summarize the AsciiDoc (respectively AsciiDoctor) features used within this guide.

[TIP]
--
We found the following information especially helpful for learning asciidoc: 

* http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide[AsciiDoctor Writers Guide]

=== Headings

=== Cross-References


<<some-anchor,explanation>> creates a link to the explanation of some-anchor.

can use the cross-reference in a list, but not with labelled-list:

. <<some-anchor, pattern name>>  labelled-list with cross-reference does not work
. *<<some-anchor, cross-references>>* need to be boldface-formatted manualy

=== Images and Diagrams

Including images is quite easy:

----
[[caption-example]]
image::aim42-logo.png["alternate-text", title="caption-example"]
----
[[caption-example]]
image::aim42-logo.png["alternate-text", title="caption-example"]


You can even reference these images, like see figure <<caption-example>>:

----
...see figure <<caption-example>>
----

I currently have no clue how to reference figure-numbers (their counter), though...


=== Lists

----
* first entry
* one more

=== Admonitions

Special annotations rendering nicely:

----
NOTE: Admonition paragraphs call attention to special words of advice

WARNING: a warning

CAUTION: be careful

IMPORTANT: must be really worth reading

TIP: maybe some practice report

[TIP]
--
Multi-line admonitions blocks need special treatment: 

they need a block-masquerading (e.g. by "--" at the beginning and end.

The result is rendered nicely.

Files are included with the "include" directive:

=== Attributes
Some attributes are useful, e.g.
----
{docdate}
----
will insert the last modification data (here: {docdate})

=== Footnotes
In case you need a footnote - that's easy too:
----
A statement.footnote:[the text of this footnote, usually rendered at the end of the document.]
----

=== Typesetting
Sometimes it can be useful to write [small]#smaller text#.
