=== Capture Quality Requirements 

==== Intent
Make the specific quality requirements of a system explicit.


==== Description

Invite authoritative stakeholders to a joint workshop (e.g. half- or full-day). 
Let them write _quality scenarios_ to describe their specific quality requirements for the system. Moderate this workshop.

* Use _scenarios_ to formulate specific quality requirements.
* Order those scenarios within a mostly hierachical quality tree, similar to <<ISO-9126>>.

TODO:

* explain scenarios, use diagram
* example scenarios
* explain quality tree
* explain brainstorming session, moderated workshop

===== Scenario-based Quality Description

Scenario:: describes the reaction of a system to a certain event (or type of event).

Although this definition is concise, it needs some explanation to become understandable. See figure <<quality-scenario-diagram>>:

* An _event_ can be a user clicking a button, an administrator starting or stopping the system, or a hacker trying to get unauthorized access. An _event_ can also be a manager needing another feature, another manager wanting to reduce operation costs, or some government agency requiring financial data to be tamper-proof. 

==== Experiences

* *Needs moderation*: Brainstorming quality requirements usually works well in moderated workshops. If given (even trivial) examples, every stakeholder will most likely write down several scenarios. We often received 80-120 different scenarios in one-day workshops.
* *Uncovers problems and risks*: Scenarios collected within brainstorming sessions often contain _hidden_ problem descriptions, risks or problems with the current systems.
* *Covers organization and process*: Scenarios sometimes cover process or organizational aspects (like: release cycles should be faster than they are now). Move those to your <<improvement-backlog>>.
* *Improves human communication*: Different stakeholders often start communicating about the systeme or their requirements during such workshops. This kind of interaction _should_ have happened long before...


==== Applicability
Use this practice when (authoritative) stakeholders are available for discussion or a workshop.

If you have well-documented, specific and current (!) quality requirements available, you might consider skipping this practice for now (although we're quite sure it's a good opportunity to learn a lot about the system, its stakeholders, their requirements and opinions).

==== Consequences

* The required constraints (aka quality attributes) of a system are made explicit.

==== Also Known As
* Non-functional requirements (although this term is misleading, as _functional_ requirements strongly influence the _quality_ of any system!)
* Documentation of quality requirements.
