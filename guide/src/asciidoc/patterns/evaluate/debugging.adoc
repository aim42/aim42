[[Debugging]]

=== Debugging 


==== Intent
Identify the source of an error ( _bug_) or misbehavior by observing the flow of execution of a program in detail.


TIP: Many software developers we met violated the basic rules of debugging. They worked in haste, took wrong assumptions, imagined-instead-of-read or simply hunted bugs at the wrong parts of the system.

==== Description
Debuggers are well-known and important tools for most software developers. Yet - finding bugs is often more difficult than expected - despite powerful tool support. 

Approach the search for bugs, errors in the following order:

. Get a clear and precise *description* of the error, the detailed wording of all error messages, log messages, stacktraces or similar information. 
. Know the *context* of the error: the exact version of the system, the operating system, involved middleware, hardware settings and so on.
. *Minimize external disturbance* while searching for errors, you need to concentrate and observe details. Shut off chat and twitter clients, notifications and your phone.
. *Reproduce the error* in the live system. Don't rely on the assumption you can reproduce it - make sure you can reliably _really_ reproduce it. 
. *Obtain the exact version* of all required source code and all involved data.
. *Reproduce the error in development environment*: This ensures your development environment is consistent to the live system. 
. *Understand the error scenario*: You need to know the business or technical scenario (aka the process or activity flow) of the error: What steps within the system or at its external interfaces precede the error? This step is an example of <<View-Based-Understanding>>. 
    .. Make this scenario *explicit* - draw or scribble a diagram. See the diagram "Divide and conquer" below as an example.

    .. *Plan your debugging strategy*: Think of the expected outcome of every part of 
       your scenario.  
    .. If you know you're traveling to Pisa (Italy), you won't confuse the Leading Tower with an error.

. *Look, don't imagine*: Sherlock Holmes, the succesful detective has formulated the golden rule of debugging: "_It's a capital mistake to theorize before one has data_". Look _exactly_ what the messages are, read carefully.
. *Change only one thing at a time*: Aim for errors with a pistol, not with a scattergun.
. Apply the *4-Eye-Principle*: Describe the problem and your state-of-debugging to somebody else. Especially clarify all your assumptions.



==== Experiences
If locating errors takes very long, you're propably facing one of the following issues:

* You suffer from any assumption that's currently not valid
* You _think_ something instead of _observing_ it - you let your mind deceive your eyes or ears.
* You ignore the context: you test a wrong version, with wrong data or a wrong operating system. 

==== Applicability
* Whenever a bug or misbehavior of a program is reported, debugging can help identify its root cause.
* Debugging can help in understanding a system by make its inner working explicit.
