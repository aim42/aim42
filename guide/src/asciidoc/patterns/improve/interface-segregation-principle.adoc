=== Interface Segregation Principle

==== Intent

Reduce coupling between clients and service providers.


==== Description 

Service components may provide more functionality than required by one client. 
To remove the client's dependency from functionality not required introduce interfaces that are tailored
to the client's needs.


==== Applicability
Apply when

* clients only require a restricted functionality from a complex service,
* you have to deal with low cohesion components you cannot change

==== Consequences

* Reduces coupling between client and service providers. Changing the service provider interface will affect fewer clients.
* Introduces additional interfaces that must be maintained.
* You have to find a good compromise between "good client fit" and the number of interfaces.
