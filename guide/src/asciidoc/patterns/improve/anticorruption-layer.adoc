=== Introduce "Anticorruption Layer"



==== Intent

An anticorruption layer is a logical layer that provides a stable interface to (potentially) volatile software components. As long as this interface remains untouched developers can implement changes or even exchange own or third-party software without affecting the clients.

==== Description


==== Experiences 

Here are some real-life experiences
* Anticorruption layer for a search-index to defer the decision if the best performance can be achieved with Elastic Search, Solr or a self-developed Lucene index.

==== Applicability

Apply this pattern when clients shall be protected from internal changes in a module or subsystem.

==== Consequences

* Allows to (ex)change software elements without affecting depending components
* Introduces one more level of indirection and thus may increase complexity

==== Also Known As

==== Related Patterns

* <<Isolate-Changes>>, as an alternative or complimenting approach
