Workflow to add a new pattern

. Add the pattern to the related section in analyze.adoc, evaluate.adoc or
improve.adoc
Use the exact writing (e.g. including dashes) you intend to use in the pattern
description
. Add the pattern to the pattern catalog in pattern-index.adoc with an entry of 
_\[[the-exact-name-from-the-previous-step]]_  and include a reference to the
detailed description with a *different* name
(e.g. by prefixing the name with "pattern-").
. Add an include statement below the patter overview in analyze.adoc,
evaluate.adoc or improve.adoc and create the according file unter the pattern subdirectory
