=== Goals

. Plan and coordinate measures and remedies to eliminate problems and issues found during <<Analyze, analysis>>.

. Apply the remedies

* Change code, structures, concepts or processes to achieve better software,
* reduce costs and/or technical debt,
* Eliminate issues found during analysis phase,
* Optimize quality attributes (like performance, maintainability, security),
* Optimize operation and administration processes, effort and cost.


==== Refactoring Source Code
One important part of improving systems is refactoring, as initially described by <<Fowler-Refactoring>>.

In our opinion, several refactoring patterns are especially important:

* <<Handle If-Else-Chains>>: eliminate nested if-then-else blocks, so that code becomes more understandable.
