=== Goals

Make the issues, problems and risks found during the <<Analyze, analysis>> comparable by
estimating their *value* (that's why we call this activity *evaluate*):

. estimate _value_ of problems, issues, risks and their remedies 
. prioritize issues, their remedies and improvement measures 


=== Pattern and Practices for Evaluation
(given in alphabetical order)

* <<Impact-Analysis>>

[[Estimate-Feature-Value]]
==== Estimate Feature Value
Estimate the (monetary) value of a given feature, so you can compare features of the system with each other.

* Involve business or management stakeholders, as they often have a clear notion of business value.
* If you cannot determine real numbers available, use <<Explicit-Assumption, explicit assumptions>> 
* Instead of numbers, you might use categories or orders-of-magnitude (like small, medium, large). You should prefer numbers, though!


[[Estimate-In-Interval]]
==== Estimate in Interval 
Estimation is a guess, not a *measurement*. Estimates are uncertain, otherwise they would be observations (or measurements!). 

Therefore, estimate in intervals, giving a lower and upper bound to your estimate. The difference between the two shows your confidence in the estimate. If this difference is relatively small, it shows high confidence.

CAUTION: Be aware of the anchoring effect http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring

Good estimates ensure that the estimated value will be contained in the interval with a very high probability.

Estimates often rely on assumptions - which you should <<Explicit-Assumption, name and describe explicitly>>. 


[[Estimate-Problem-Cost]]
==== Estimate Problem Cost
Estimate how much a given problem costs (in money or effort) in a period of time. 

For example, if a server needs to be rebooted once every 24hrs and an operator needs 30 minutes to perform this reboot (and corresponding activities) - then you can approximate the cost of this problem for, let's say, a month:

5 workdays * 4 weeks * 30 min = 10hrs of operator-effort.

If you multiply with (approximate or average) wage, you get _problem cost_.

* If you cannot determine real numbers available, use <<Explicit-Assumption, explicit assumptions>> 


[[Estimate-Remedy-Cost]]
==== Estimate Remedy Cost
